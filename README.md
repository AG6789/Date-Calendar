# Days & Calendars

Date-Day:

Input a date, any date ;)
The output will be the day of the week that day will fall on. It has its limitations, Python can't handle more than 10^7ish days, or about 30k years +- today. 

Calendar:

Input a month, any month, any year.
The output will be the calendar for that month. Again, same limitations as above apply :)
